# STREAM IT
Asynchronous API Client-Side Capstone Project from [Thinkful's](https://www.thinkful.com/) fullstack web development program. 

Stream It is a search engine for users to find out exactly where and for how much they can currently stream a movie or tv show and view ratings as well as other useful information. It makes the process of searching for titles across multiple streaming platforms as easy as a few clicks. Currently leverages about 340 sources.

## Project Requirements
* The app should do something interesting: The overarching UX (user experience) requirement for this app is that it pulls in data from a third party API and displays that data in some way to your user. It's up to you to figure out how to make this experience feel compelling to the user, and who it is that you want to make something interesting for.
* Polished appearance for final version: Initially, you'll implement a minimal, functional prototype of your app, which you'll use to get feedback on your app's features. While the first version should not be polished, the final version you submit should be. We'll go into greater detail about what this means in the assignment dedicated to styling your app.
* Responsive: The final version of your app should work on both mobile and desktop.
